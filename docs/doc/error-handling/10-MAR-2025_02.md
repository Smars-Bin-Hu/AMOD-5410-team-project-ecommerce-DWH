# Troubleshooting: Partitioned table NO DATA displayed while hive SQL query, even though data file existing on HDFS

## Issue Summary
While querying the `ods_orderitem_ipd` table in Hive, the query consistently failed to retrieve data from newly added partitions. The metadata did not update with new partitions, even though the partition directories and data files existed in HDFS.

## Symptoms
- **MSCK REPAIR TABLE ods_orderitem_ipd;** did not update Hive metadata with new partitions.
- Querying the table did not return any data for newly added partitions.
- No error or warning messages were displayed, making debugging difficult.
- HDFS confirmed that partition directories and Avro files were correctly present.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by an incorrect `LOCATION` path in the Hive table definition.

- **Incorrect LOCATION (causing the issue)**:
  ```sql
    LOCATION '/user/hive/warehouse/ods/ods_ordersitem_ipd';
  ```
There was an extra **"s"** in `ods_ordersitem_ipd`, pointing to a non-existent directory.

- **Correct LOCATION (fixing the issue)**:
  ```sql
  LOCATION '/user/hive/warehouse/ods/ods_orderitem_ipd';
  ```
  The incorrect location caused Hive to look for partitions in a non-existent path, preventing it from detecting and updating metadata with new partitions.

## Lessons Learned
1. Always verify the `LOCATION` path in the table creation statement when facing partition-related issues.
2. Hive does not provide explicit errors or warnings when the `LOCATION` path is incorrect, making debugging more challenging.
3. If `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` does not update partitions, manually compare the `LOCATION` path with the actual HDFS directory.
4. Use `DESCRIBE FORMATTED ods_orderitem_ipd;` to check the tableâ€™s metadata and confirm the actual location.

## Recommended Debugging Steps
1. **Check the actual location of the table**:
   ```sql
   DESCRIBE FORMATTED ods_orderitem_ipd;
   ```
   Ensure the `LOCATION` matches the intended HDFS path.

2. **Verify HDFS directory existence**:
   ```bash
   hdfs dfs -ls /user/hive/warehouse/ods/ods_orderitem_ipd/
   ```

3. **Check for partitions in Hive metadata**:
   ```sql
   SHOW PARTITIONS ods_orderitem_ipd;
   ```

4. **Manually add partitions if necessary**:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE ods_orderitem_ipd ADD PARTITION (data_date='2025-03-10') 
   LOCATION '/user/hive/warehouse/ods/ods_orderitem_ipd/data_date=2025-03-10';
   ```

By following these steps, you can quickly diagnose and resolve Hive partition issues related to incorrect `LOCATION` paths.

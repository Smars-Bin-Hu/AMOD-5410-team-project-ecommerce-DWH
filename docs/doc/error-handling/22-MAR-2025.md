# Troubleshooting Document: Git Line Ending Conversion Issue Causing JournalNode/NameNode Startup Failure

## 1. Issue Description

When developing on Windows, Git by default converts Unix-style line endings (LF) to Windows-style line endings (CRLF) when checking out files. This conversion can cause problems when these files (e.g., scripts like `hadoop-env.sh`) are used in a Linux or container environment. The interpreter then sees the extra carriage return (`\r`) character, leading to errors such as:

```
root@hadoop-master:/# hdfs --daemon start namenode && hdfs --daemon start ...
/usr/local/opt/module/hadoop/etc/hadoop/hadoop-env.sh: line 1: $'\r': command not found
```

Additionally, NameNode logs may display errors like:

```
Error replaying edit log at offset 0. Expected transaction ID was 3419
got premature end-of-file at txid 3170; expected file to go up to 3419
```

These errors indicate that due to the incorrect line endings, the startup process fails to properly read and replay the edit logs.

## 2. Root Cause

**Root Cause:**
- On Windows, Git automatically converts line endings from LF (Unix-style) to CRLF (Windows-style).
- When these files are mounted in a Linux/container environment, the extra `\r` character is interpreted as an invalid command, causing the startup failure and issues with reading the edit log.

## 3. Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Review Error Logs**
    - Check the NameNode or JournalNode startup logs to locate errors mentioning `$'\r': command not found` or edit log issues.

2. **Examine File Line Endings**
    - Log into the container and run:
      ```bash
      cat -A /usr/local/opt/module/hadoop/etc/hadoop/hadoop-env.sh
      ```
      to see if the file ends with `^M` (which represents CR).

3. **Identify the Source of the Issue**
    - Confirm that the mounted project directory was developed and committed on Windows, where Git might have automatically converted LF to CRLF.

## 4. Solutions

### A. Enforce Line Endings with .gitattributes

Create or update a `.gitattributes` file in your project's root directory to force all text files to use Unix-style LF endings. For example:

```gitattributes
# Enforce LF for all text files
* text=auto eol=lf

# For common script files, enforce LF
*.sh          text eol=lf
*.bash        text eol=lf
*.zsh         text eol=lf

# For common configuration files
*.yaml        text eol=lf
*.yml         text eol=lf
*.json        text eol=lf
*.properties  text eol=lf
*.conf        text eol=lf
*.cfg         text eol=lf
*.ini         text eol=lf

# For common source code files
*.c           text eol=lf
*.cpp         text eol=lf
*.h           text eol=lf
*.hpp         text eol=lf
*.java        text eol=lf
*.py          text eol=lf
*.js          text eol=lf
*.ts          text eol=lf
*.jsx         text eol=lf
*.tsx         text eol=lf
*.php         text eol=lf
*.go          text eol=lf
*.rb          text eol=lf
*.cs          text eol=lf
*.scala       text eol=lf
*.kt          text eol=lf

# For documentation files
*.txt         text eol=lf
*.md          text eol=lf
*.markdown    text eol=lf

# Binary files (no conversion)
*.png         binary
*.jpg         binary
*.jpeg        binary
*.gif         binary
*.ico         binary
*.pdf         binary
*.doc         binary
*.docx        binary
*.ppt         binary
*.pptx        binary
*.xls         binary
*.xlsx        binary
*.zip         binary
*.gz          binary
*.tgz         binary
*.bz2         binary
*.rar         binary
*.7z          binary
*.exe         binary
*.dll         binary
*.so          binary
*.dylib       binary
```

**Note:** After modifying `.gitattributes`, you should re-normalize your files so that the correct line endings are applied:
```bash
git rm --cached -r .
git commit -m "Normalize line endings"
git push
git checkout -- .
```

### B. Temporarily Convert File Line Endings

If updating Git settings is not immediately possible, convert the file's line endings in the container:

- Using `dos2unix`:
  ```bash
  dos2unix /usr/local/opt/module/hadoop/etc/hadoop/hadoop-env.sh
  ```
- Or using `sed`:
  ```bash
  sed -i 's/\r$//' /usr/local/opt/module/hadoop/etc/hadoop/hadoop-env.sh
  ```

## 5. Preventive Measures

1. **Set Git Line Ending Policy Globally on Windows:**  
   Configure Git on Windows to commit with LF by default:
   ```bash
   git config --global core.autocrlf input
   ```
   This will convert CRLF to LF on commit.

2. **Use Consistent Editor Settings:**  
   Ensure all team members use editors that display and enforce Unix (LF) line endings.

3. **Regularly Verify Critical Files:**  
   Before deployment, verify that scripts and configuration files mounted in Linux environments have the correct LF endings.

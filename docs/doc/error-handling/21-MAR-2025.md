# Troubleshooting NameNode Startup Failure in Hadoop HA Environment

## Issue Overview

In a Hadoop High Availability (HA) cluster setup (HA + JournalNode + ZooKeeper), attempting to start the NameNode or run `hdfs namenode -recover` results in the following error:

```
There appears to be a gap in the edit log.  We expected txid 3420, but got txid 3421.
```

As a result, the NameNode fails to start.

##  Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Background

This issue occurred after the following sequence:

- A running Hadoop cluster (NameNode, JournalNode, ZooKeeper, etc.)
- A `docker commit` was performed on the running container, and the image was pushed to Docker Hub
- A new container was launched using the committed image via `docker run`, **without mounting any volume**
- NameNode failed to start with the error above

### 2. Cause Breakdown

#### Difference Between `docker restart` and `docker commit`

| Operation                  | Description                     | Data State                                               |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `docker restart`          | Restarts the same container      | Retains full runtime filesystem, edit logs remain intact |
| `docker commit` + `run`   | Creates a new container from image | Snapshot may miss in-progress or unflushed data          |

> Though both methods donâ€™t explicitly shut down Hadoop, `docker commit` creates a snapshot that may contain inconsistent or incomplete log files.

#### Missing EditLog Files in JournalNode

- During recovery, the NameNode fetches edit logs (e.g., txid 3420) from the JournalNodes
- If even one JournalNode lacks that txid log file, NameNode cannot proceed with recovery
- This results in a `gap in the edit log` error and startup failure

---

## Solution

### 1. Check EditLog Consistency

Inspect and compare the edit logs in:

```bash
# On NameNode
$HADOOP_HOME/data/name/current

# On JournalNode (example path)
$HADOOP_HOME/data/journal/ns-ha/current
```

Identify missing edit logs. In this case:

```
edits_0000000000000003420-0000000000000003420
edits_0000000000000003421-0000000000000003451
```

### 2. Restore Missing EditLogs to JournalNode

Copy the missing edit log files from the NameNode to all JournalNodes:

```bash
scp edits_0000000000000003420-0000000000000003420 \
    edits_0000000000000003421-0000000000000003451 \
    hadoop-workerX:/usr/local/opt/module/hadoop/data/journal/ns-ha/current/
```

Ensure **all JournalNodes** have a complete and consistent edit log sequence.

### 3. Restart NameNode

Start the NameNode again:

```bash
hdfs namenode
```

Verify that it successfully replays the edit logs and starts without errors.

## Additional Recommendations

- **Avoid committing containers while Hadoop is running.** If you need to `commit`:
    - Gracefully shut down NameNode, JournalNode, ZooKeeper
    - Ensure all edits are flushed to disk before committing
- **Use mounted volumes** to persist metadata directories like `$HADOOP_HOME/data`
- **Regularly back up JournalNode logs** for recovery and troubleshooting purposes

---

## Conclusion

This issue was caused by missing edit logs in JournalNodes after using `docker commit`, which led to a metadata gap during NameNode startup. Manually restoring the missing edit log files to JournalNodes resolved the inconsistency, and the cluster resumed normal operation.

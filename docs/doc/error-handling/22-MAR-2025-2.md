# **Preventing SIGHUP from Killing Background Processes When Using Docker `exec -it`**

## **1. Overview**

When running commands in a Docker container via:
```bash
docker exec -it <container> bash -c "<command>"
```
you might notice that any background daemon processes started by `<command>` can get **killed by a SIGHUP** as soon as the `docker exec` session ends. This commonly affects components in distributed systems – for example, Hadoop’s `JournalNode` or other daemons that start in the background but do not fully detach from the TTY session.

### **Typical Symptom**

- Inside the container (using a direct `bash` session), running something like:
  ```bash
  hdfs --daemon start journalnode
  ```
  works fine: the process remains alive.
- From outside the container using:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it <container> bash -c "hdfs --daemon start journalnode"
  ```
  the command appears to succeed, but the process immediately exits.
- Logs often show **`RECEIVED SIGNAL 1: SIGHUP`**, indicating the daemon shut down after the TTY session ended.

## **2. Why It Happens**

1. **`-t` Allocates a Pseudo-TTY**
    - When Docker allocates a TTY (`-t`), the container spawns a pseudo-terminal session.
    - Once the command completes, closing the TTY **sends SIGHUP to processes** associated with that session.
2. **Background Process Not Fully Detached**
    - Tools like `hdfs --daemon start journalnode` might fork to the background but still remain attached to the session or inherit signals from the parent shell.
    - Therefore, when the `docker exec` shell exits (along with the TTY), SIGHUP is broadcast, and the daemon receives it.

Meanwhile, some scripts (e.g., ZooKeeper’s `zkServer.sh`) incorporate additional `nohup` or session management that ignores SIGHUP by default, so they survive. However, Hadoop’s `JournalNode` script does not fully detach or ignore SIGHUP by default.

## **3. Diagnosing the Issue**

- **Check Logs**: In Hadoop’s `logs/` directory, you may see something like:
  ```
  2025-03-22 13:33:38,009 ERROR org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.qjournal.server.JournalNode: RECEIVED SIGNAL 1: SIGHUP
  2025-03-22 13:33:38,019 INFO  org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.qjournal.server.JournalNode: SHUTDOWN_MSG: ...
  ```
  This confirms the daemon was explicitly killed by SIGHUP.
- **Compare Behavior**:
    - **Inside container** (interactive shell): process persists.
    - **From `docker exec -it`**: process dies after the command finishes.

## **4. Solutions**

### **4.1 Omit `-t` (no pseudo-TTY)**

If you do **not** need an interactive TTY for user input, simply remove `-t`:
```bash
docker exec -i <container> bash -c "hdfs --daemon start journalnode"
```
or even:
```bash
docker exec <container> bash -c "hdfs --daemon start journalnode"
```
This way, the container does **not** allocate a pseudo-terminal, so there is no TTY-based SIGHUP when the command exits.

### **4.2 Ignore SIGHUP in the Script**

Inside your startup script (e.g., `my-start-zk.sh`), you can do:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

# Start ZK
zkServer.sh start

# Ignore the hangup signal in this shell
trap "" SIGHUP

# Now start JournalNode
hdfs --daemon start journalnode

# Optionally put it in the background with nohup if needed
nohup hdfs --daemon start journalnode &>/dev/null &
```
By ignoring SIGHUP or using `nohup` + `setsid`, the new process fully detaches and remains running even after the parent shell terminates.

### **4.3 Use `setsid`**

`setsid` is a utility to run the command in a new session, fully detached from the current TTY:
```bash
setsid hdfs --daemon start journalnode
```
or
```bash
setsid nohup hdfs --daemon start journalnode &>/dev/null &
```
Either approach prevents SIGHUP from being delivered to the daemon when the `docker exec` shell exits.

### **4.4 Manage Processes with a Supervisor**

For production environments, it’s often more robust to run multiple services inside a container using an **init** or **process supervisor** (e.g., `supervisord`, `s6`, `runit`) as PID 1 in the container. These managers handle signal forwarding properly and keep processes running regardless of `docker exec` usage.

---

## **5. Summary**

- **Root Cause**: Allocating a TTY (`-t`) inside `docker exec` creates a pseudo-terminal session. When that session ends, SIGHUP is sent to child processes.
- **Fix**: Remove `-t`, or ensure the daemon ignores SIGHUP (via `trap "" SIGHUP`, `nohup`, `setsid`, or a supervisor).
- **Recommended**: If you need interactive shells (`-t`), then **explicitly** ignore or detach signals for the background services. Otherwise, skip `-t`.

By adopting one of these strategies, you can consistently start background services (like Hadoop JournalNode) in a container without them getting killed the moment you exit the `docker exec` session.
